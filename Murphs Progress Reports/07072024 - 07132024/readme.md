Been messing around with the main yaw stepper motor. Got it working smoothly at a higher voltage, barely higher. I need a pocket battery that can put out consistent amperage

Made a janky ass connector for my power bank to connect both of the usb outputs in parallel for extra amperage. Kinda worked, tried to boost it up to 5.25 volts. Im gonna need to find a better battery and clean everything up. Gonna need to redo case for everything at least one more time. Met with the team. Oh yeah, i got mikes unity code running on my home computer and was able to view the video from my headset in unity. Top priority right now is find new battery, one that is like 8 volts ish and a reliable way to charge it.
