Picked up the 3D print today, still turned out pretty bad cause there were no supports in a critical area. Probably gonna restart

Now using the gpio pins as the input for the power. I got a usb cable and cut it, stripped it, then professionally hot glued the cable to the raspberry pi. Added a very distinguished, stunning, switch. Hopefully the wires carrying power to the gpio pins are thick enough.

Gonna start designing a new case around this solution

Almost got a new design drawn up, gonna have holes to attach either camera mount

Got the new case finished and sent it to the marriot library 3D printers.

Found out my raspbverry pi is missing 4 smd capacitors. I got the most updated casee from the library, seems to be goood, ill have to move the ghetto switch somewhere else.
