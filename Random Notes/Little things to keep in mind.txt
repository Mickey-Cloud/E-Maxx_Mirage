How far can robot go?
What should the range be?
Will we need to modify the wireless antenna to make it go farther?
Should we use a directional antenna?
What camera have we decided on?
Show connection strength status on the VR HUD.
Use a LIDAR scanner / camera to create a surrounding area map to display in the VR HUD
Create a simulation of the wireless signal propogation in matlab using FDTD model.
We are going to need transievers, both the robot and control station need to transmit and receive.
