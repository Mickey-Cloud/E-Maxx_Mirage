# Steering Wheel Code Changelog

# 4/28/2024
 Before today steering wheel code just reads inputs and displays the values in the terminal. After work today the steering wheel code now can interrperet data from the wheel and correclty assign a value to a potentiometer. There are 3 speed levels 25 percent 50 percent and full speed. The program defaults to 25 percent. The user can use the left paddle to set to 25 right to 50 and xbox button to full speed. The steering can also be changed by pressing a for normal steering. b for 50 percent steering meaning the user only has to turn the wheel 50 percent for full steering effect and y for 25 percent steering. Currently these values are printed to the terminal and are not actually transmitted through i2c yet.
